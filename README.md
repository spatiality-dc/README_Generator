## User-Story

```
GIVEN the developer has a GitHub profile and a repository
WHEN prompted for the developer's GitHub username and repo specific information
THEN a README for the repo is generated
```

## Challenge

As expected with this course, there were a number of challenges with this exercise. Utilising async functions that feed into other functions was difficult to understand at time.

## Screenshots

Upon completion of the task, my command line application can be seen in the gif below.

## Results

The required outputs of this project, including this README, the url of the deployed web application and the url of this repo.

- Github Repo - https://github.com/spatiality-dc/README_Generator

## Lessons Learned

- Javascript is still hard.

- I legitmately only found the "Develop" folder on the day of submission. So I guess one lesson is to read the documentation thoroughly and avoid breaking my brain trying to fit everything into on file.
